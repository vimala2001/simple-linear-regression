# simple-linear-regression
A METHOD OF DATA ANALYSIS THAT AUTOMATES ANALYTICAL MODEL BUILDING.IT'S A TYPE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE THAT ALLOWS SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS TO BECOME MORE ACCURATE AT PREDICTING OUTCOMES WITHOUT BEING EXPLICITLY PROGRAMMED TO DO SO.

SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION

A REGRESSION MODEL THAT ESTIMATES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ONE INDEPENDENT VARIABLE AND ONE DEPENDENT VARIABLE USING A STRAIGHT LINE.

[y =mx+c]

where both the variables should be quantitative

DATA SET

IT'S A COLLECTION OF DATA,NUMBERS,OR VALUES THAT RELATE TO A PARTICULAR SUBJECT.

IT CAN HOLD INFORMATION SUCH AS MEDICAL RECORDS,INSURANCE RECORDS,TO BE USED BY A PROGRAM RUNNING ON THE SYSTEM. DATA SETS ARE ALSO USED TO STORE INFORMATION NEEDED BY APPLICATIONS

DATA VISUALISATION

THE PROCESS OF TRANSLATING LARGE DATA SETS AND METRICS INTO CHARTS,GRAPH,AND OTHER VISUALS WHICH IS HELPFUL TO CONDUCT ANALYSES SUCH AS PREDICTIVE ANALYSIS WHICH CAN SERVE AS HELPFUL VISUALISATION TO PRESENT

SUPERVISED LEARNING

THE MACHINE LEARNING TASK OF LEARNING A FUNCTION THAT MAPS AN INPUT TO AN OUTPUT BASED ON EXAMPLE INPUT-OUTPUT PAIRS. THE MODEL IS TRAINED USING 'LABELED DATA'. DATASETS ARE SAID TO CONTAIN LABELS THAT CONTAIN BOTH INPUT AND OUTPUT PARAMETERS. TO SIMPLIFY-' DATA IS ALREAY TAGGED WITH THE CORRECT ANSWER'.

MODELS

THOSE ARE OUTPUT BY ALGORITHMS AND ARE COMPRISED OF MODEL DATA AND A PREDICTION ALGORITHM.

IN SUPERVISED LEARNING, AN ML ALGORITHM BUILDS A MODEL BY EXAMINING MANY EXAMPLES AND ATTEMPTING TO FIND A MODEL THAT MINIMIZES LOSS AND IMPROVES PREDICTION ACCURACY.
